                  Purpose
---------------------------------------------------
I'm Merijn, an ambitious student of computational 
social science. Here I help companies with digital 
and data-driven solutions for various societal 
problems, constantly exploring new challenges and 
growth opportunities. This passion for new 
challenges is also visible in the rest of my life, 
in which I like to help people. I also love making 
videos and podcasts, and I like to learn new things 
by watching YouTube videos about interesting topics. 
I also like to read (yes, in a real book). The books 
I read are a variation of non-fiction (Digital 
minimalism, Atomic Habits) and fiction (Ready Player 
One, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow). In my 
spare time I also run.
